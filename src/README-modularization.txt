Modularization strategy:

- tunings.js: tuning tables and frequency logic
- audio.js: Web Audio API logic (oscillator management, tuning, volume)
- state.js: app state and state management
- ui.js: UI creation, event binding, and DOM updates
- index.js: entry point, initializes the app

This structure separates concerns for maintainability and extensibility.
